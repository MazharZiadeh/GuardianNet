# GuardianNet
GuardianNet is an AI oversight system that detects and mitigates bias in text generation. It profiles AI behavior, detects anomalies, and corrects outputs using an intervention engine. With adaptive self-reward learning (ASRL), it continuously refines its monitoring, ensuring ethical and unbiased AI responses. 

# GuardianNet: The Self-Evolving AI Overseer

## GuardianNet Demo

Welcome to **GuardianNet**, an advanced AI oversight system that autonomously monitors, corrects, and evolves to ensure fairness, safety, and ethical alignment in AI behavior. Acting as a real-time **"babysitter"** for subordinate AI models, GuardianNet provides dynamic, self-learning oversight—ensuring responsible AI deployment.

---
## Overview
**GuardianNet** introduces a novel approach to AI safety, using **self-evolving oversight** that adapts dynamically to AI behaviors without rigid rule-based programming.

Core innovations include:
- **Behavioral Echo Chamber** – Predicts expected outputs for comparison.
- **Adaptive Supervisory Reinforcement Learning (ASRL)** – Evolves supervisory tactics dynamically.
- **Real-time Intervention** – Detects and corrects biases, toxicity, and misinformation on the fly.

In this demo, **GuardianNet supervises a transformer-based chatbot**, ensuring its responses remain ethical and unbiased. The **Ethics Dashboard** visualizes interventions and ethical drift in real-time, providing a clear picture of AI governance.

---
## Features
✅ **Real-Time Monitoring** – Profiles AI behavior dynamically using the **Behavioral Echo Chamber**.

✅ **Anomaly Detection** – Identifies biases, toxicity, and misinformation with adaptive scoring.

✅ **Intervention Engine** – Instantly corrects outputs and fine-tunes AI weights. _(Example: "I hate you" → "I like you")_

✅ **Adaptive Supervision** – Adjusts sensitivity based on an **Ethics Drift** metric using ASRL.

✅ **Ethics Dashboard** – A visually engaging console UI tracking live interventions and ethical drift.

✅ **Scalable & Novel** – Can be extended to larger models, multi-AI supervision, or integrated with existing frameworks.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.8+**
- **PyTorch** (`pip install torch`)
- **NumPy** (`pip install numpy`)
- **Colorama** (`pip install colorama`) _(For vibrant console output)_

### Setup
Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/guardiannet.git
cd guardiannet
```
_(Update with your actual repo URL once hosted!)_

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Or manually:
```bash
pip install torch numpy colorama
```

Run the demo:
```bash
python guardian_net_demo.py
```

---
## Usage
### Launch the Demo
Execute the script to see GuardianNet in action:
```bash
python guardian_net_demo.py
```
The **Ethics Dashboard** will light up as it processes test inputs like _"I hate you"_ or _"fake news."_

### Customize Inputs
Modify `test_inputs` in `guardian_net_demo.py` to test custom phrases:
```python
test_inputs = ["your custom input", "another one"]
```

### Extend the Chatbot
Modify the vocabulary list or swap the mini-transformer with a larger pre-trained model (e.g., **GPT-2**) for enhanced complexity.

## How It Works
1. **Subordinate AI** – A mini-transformer chatbot generates responses, trained with slight bias (e.g., "she is great").
2. **Behavioral Echo Chamber** – Mirrors chatbot behavior to predict expected responses.
3. **Anomaly Detection** – Scores deviations and flags bias/toxicity.
4. **Intervention Engine** – Rewrites outputs and fine-tunes the chatbot.
5. **ASRL Meta-Learner** – Tracks ethics drift and refines supervision dynamically.

---
## Why It’s Amazing
🚀 **Futuristic Tech** – Integrates transformers, reinforcement learning, and an **echo chamber** concept.

📊 **Visual Appeal** – The **Ethics Dashboard** is perfect for demos, presentations, and LinkedIn highlights.

🌍 **Real-World Impact** – Addresses **bias, toxicity, and misinformation**, crucial for AI ethics.

📈 **Scalable** – Easily extends to **larger models and multi-AI systems** with minimal tweaks.
